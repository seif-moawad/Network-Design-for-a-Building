Introduction

Welcome to the Network Design for Building G project! In this project, we have designed a network infrastructure for a building consisting of two floors. The network is designed to cater to the specific needs of the building, including computer labs, student computers, lecturer terminals, service devices, security cameras, and attendance systems. The network design ensures connectivity, security, and efficient data flow throughout the building. Let's explore the key features and details of our Network Design for Building G!
Features

    Two Floors: The building has two floors, each with specific network requirements.

    Computer Labs: Each floor contains 20 computer labs for educational purposes.

    Student Computers: Each floor is equipped with 30 student computers.

    Lecturer Terminals: A terminal PC is provided for the lecturers.

    Data Outlets: Four extra data outlets are available on each floor for future needs.

    Service Devices: Each floor is equipped with four access points, four printers, and six scanners to cater to the needs of the users.

    Cameras and RFID Devices: Six cameras are installed for monitoring and security purposes. Four RFID devices are used for attendance tracking.

    Switches: Each category of devices is connected to a switch. The switches on each floor are connected to a main switch for that floor. The main switches are connected to the backbone switch located in the data center.

    Data Center: The data center is located on the second floor and houses 12 server devices. The servers include E-Learning servers, Application servers, Database servers, Printer servers, an E-Mail server, and a Web server. The servers are connected to a farm switch, which is then connected to the backbone switch.

    Connectivity: The backbone switch serves as the parent switch, connecting the main floor switches and room switches. The backbone switch receives data from the main router, which is connected to a DSL modem.

    Basement Floor: The basement floor houses the security room, equipped with six PCs allocated for monitoring the security cameras installed on each floor.

Usage

The network design for Building G is implemented as follows:

    Review the network diagram and the provided documentation to understand the layout and components of the network.

    Set up the necessary network infrastructure, including switches, routers, and servers, based on the design specifications.

    Ensure proper cabling and connectivity between devices, following industry best practices.

    Configure the switches, routers, and servers according to the network design requirements.

    Test the network connectivity and ensure that all devices are communicating properly.

    Monitor and maintain the network to ensure optimal performance and security.

    Provide user training and support for utilizing the network resources effectively.
